## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your App Structure

Your app needs to be restructured for Azure Static Web Apps:
```
ctrl-alt-rock-voting/
├── client/                 # React frontend (stays the same)
├── api/                   # Azure Functions (converted from server/)
├── staticwebapp.config.json # Azure configuration
└── package.json           # Root package.json
```

### Step 2: Convert Backend to Azure Functions

Azure Static Web Apps uses Azure Functions for the backend API.
We'll convert your Express.js routes to Azure Functions.

### Step 3: Deploy to Azure

1. **Go to Azure Portal** (portal.azure.com)
2. **Create Static Web App**
3. **Connect to GitHub**
4. **Auto-deploy from your repository**
